## Introduction
It seems that there isn't any packages on **PyPI** which provides full methods controlling 2x2x2 Rubik's cube:
 1. Algorithms: Methods for reversing, simplifying and some other operations to the algorithms.
 2. Virtual cube: Methods for solving, rotating faces and other operations to the cube.

To use these features in one package easily, I created this package.
